#   Personal   Expenses   App 
This is my second app ever created on Flutter. It is used to keep track of your expenses. It is a basic app that allows you to add certain transactions, delete them and observe the statistical bar chart for the last 7 days.

### Initially there are no transactions, you may add them by clicking the "+" button in the bottom or the top right of the screen

### As you add transactions, you may observe them on the scrollable screen
